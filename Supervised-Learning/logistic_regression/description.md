# Classifying Iris species using Logistic Regression :
+ To get better understanding of logistic regression, I made a logistic regression classifier (lr) and applied it to iris data set to predict one of two class label.
+ It is a standard dataset which actually contains three class labels.
+ The classier gave successfully an accuracy of 1 for both training and test dataset.
+ Further, a classifier predicting one class label out of all three class labels can be build.
