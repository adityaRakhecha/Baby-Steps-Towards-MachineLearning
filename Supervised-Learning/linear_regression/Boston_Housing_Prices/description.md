# Regression models to predict Boston Housing Prices
+ To get better understanding of linear regression, I build a linear regression model, lasso regression model, ridge regression model and applied to Boston housing dataset.
+ The goal was to predict value of homes using information such as crime rate, highway accessability, etc as features by applying different regression models.
+ Every method would give different results and this can be understood by plotting and comparing graphs of every model.
